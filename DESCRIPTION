Description: The Fisher's Exact Test is often used to measure the significance of overlap
    between two categorical variables. However, the test operates on the assumption that
    the relationship between observations is independent. Depending on how a graph is made,
    this assumption may not hold, thus making the Fisher's Exact Test invalid. This package
    offers a fast way to permute a false discovery rate (FDR) for the edge overlap between
    two non-random graphs using an odds ratio (OR) test statistic.
